  \class   oImageProcessingManager
  \brief   This class is designed to manage the different image processing modules and to apply them
  \details This manager class is supposed to be created and initialized in the main program.
           To do so, the following steps must be used: (i) The empty constructor is called which affect
           all members with default values. (ii) All parameters are set through the use of SetXXX()
           functions. (iii) The CheckParameters() function is called to check that everything mandatory
           has been set. (iv) The Initialize() function is called to initialize everything. (v) Now
           the action functions of the manager can be called to apply the different image processing modules.
           In a few words, based on supplied options, the manager will create children of the
           abstract vImageProcessingModule class which are specific image processing modules. As an example,
           see the iImageProcessingTemplate child class that illustrates how a specific image processing
           module should be implemented.
