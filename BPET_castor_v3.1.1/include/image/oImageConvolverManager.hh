  \class   oImageConvolverManager
  \brief   This class is designed to manage the different image convolvers and to apply them
  \details This manager class is supposed to be created and initialized in the main program.
           To do so, the following steps must be used: \n
           (i) The empty constructor is called which affect all members with default values. \n
           (ii) All parameters are set through the use of SetXXX() functions. \n
           (iii) The CheckParameters() function is called to check that everything mandatory
           has been set. \n 
           (iv) The Initialize() function is called to initialize everything. \n
           (v) Now the action functions of the manager can be called to apply the different image convolvers. \n
           In a few words, based on supplied options, the manager will create children of the
           abstract vImageConvolver class which are specific image convolver modules. As an example,
           see the iImageConvolverTemplate child class that illustrates how a specific image convolver
           module should be implemented.

               projection. Note that in the case of histogram-based reconstruction, the

               in synchronization with the backward images containing the correction terms.
