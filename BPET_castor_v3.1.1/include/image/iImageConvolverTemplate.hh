  \class   iImageConvolverTemplate
  \brief   This class is a template of an image convolver module to serve as an example
  \details This class is a child of vImageConvolver. It is a template of an image
           convolver module that implements all mandatory parts to be compilable but does not
           do nothing. It can be used as a starting point to implement ones own image convolver
           module. Many explanations are provided within the corpus of all functions to guide
           through the implementation of ones own module. In a few words, one simply has to
           implement few pure virtual functions inherited from the vImageConvolver abstract
           class, while observing a few rules.

               dimensions allocated and specified, and same for the actual kernels' values. If the kernel
               is stationary (i.e. only one kernel), then the m_stationary boolean should be set to true.
