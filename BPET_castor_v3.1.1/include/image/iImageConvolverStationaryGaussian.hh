  \class   iImageConvolverStationaryGaussian
  \brief   This class is an image convolver module implementing stationary gaussian filtering
  \details This class is a child of vImageConvolver. It implements a stationary gaussian
           convolution filter, parameterized by a transaxial and an axial FWHM, as well as the number
           of sigmas to be included in the convolution kernel.
