  \class   sAddonManager
  \brief   This class is designed to manage the automatic declaration of 'addon' classes
  \details An 'addon' class is any class deriving from an abstract class used for the implementation of specific modules. \n 
           As an example, the class vProjector is an abstract class that cannot be used on its own, but all its children \n 
           are implementing actual projectors that can be used. \n 
           This addon manager allows to automatically declare the existency of an 'addon' class into the CASToR project. \n 
           Based on specific macros to be added in the 'addon' class, and what is defined in this addon manager, \n
           there is nothing more to do to be able to use the 'addon' inside CASToR. \n 
           This class is a singleton. For all things to work properly, additional macros are defined inside \n
           the header file of abstract classes. \n 
           The philosophy of this 'addon' mechanism is taken from the GATE software.
